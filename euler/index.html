<h1> Euler, Leonhard</h1>
<h3> (1707-1783)</h3>

<hr /> 

<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b> Leonhard Euler </b> was born in Basel,
 Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <b> Jean Bernolli</b>. 
In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
 Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books
 and papers</em>. his influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler’s work on 
mathematical analysis, <cite>Introductio in analyzin infinitorum</cite> (1748)
 remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau
 he wrote <cite> Lettres &agrave; one princesse d’Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772),giving 
a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>

<p> 
One can hardly write mathematical equations without copying Euler. 
Notations still in use today, such as <i>e</i> and &#960; 

<!<img src=“pi.jpg” alt=“pi” />, were developed by Euler. 
He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis.
 Euler’s formula: 
</p>

<p style=“text-align: center “>cos(<i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>sin(<i>x</i>) =
 <i>e</i> <sup> (<i>ix</i>)</sup></p>

<p> demonstrates the relationship between analysis, 
trigonometry and imaginary numbers, in ne beautiful and elegant equation. 
</p>
<p> Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
